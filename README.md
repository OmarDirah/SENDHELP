##Roll-A-Ball minigame

This game is derived from a Unity tutorial. This minigame will allow the user to roll around an arena picking up characters to form a solid password. 
Once they think they are done, the game will check to ensure the necessary password requirements are met, then the minigame will be complete, or they will be made aware of their mistakes and have a chance to remedy them.

Use W, A, S, D to roll around the playing field collecting characters and avoiding bumpers. 
  The green platform is used when the player believes they have a sufficient password. 
  The red platform is used when the player wants to reset the password/level.
  
The win condition is set such that the password has enough of each character type as well as long enough
