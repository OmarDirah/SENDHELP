Cybersecurity Capping Game Project

Asteroids minigame is to serve as a fun "punishment" for the user failing at a certain point in the network security module

Use W, A, D or Up Arrow, Left Arrow, Right Arrow to navigate around the playing field and avoiding obstacles. Use the spacebar or left mouse button to shoot the obstacles. 
Once the goal score is hit, the game will end. The smaller the obstacles, the more points the user will receive.
The user is given 3 lives, such that if they collide with an obstacle 3 times before reaching the goal score, the game will reset and the user will have to start over.
