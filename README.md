### Overview
ARI is an educational first-person puzzle escape room game designed to teach good cybersecurity practices to all audiences. Our goal is to create an enjoyable learning experience through interactive gameplay while simultaneously providing a robust cybersecurity education. ARI will provide insight into the level of knowledge students or employees have and gain as they progress through the levels of the game, and it won’t break the bank in the process. 

Human error is often the biggest threat to cybersecurity. Currently, there exist few teaching software applications designed to prevent cybersecurity breaches due to this. The ones that do exist are often simple, ineffective video modules, or extremely expensive. ARI strives to provide a low cost, interactive, enjoyable, and effective way to teach people about the risks that exist in their day-to-day online activities. By teaching users about concepts like good password development and phishing, ARI aims to help prevent security breaches caused by human error. 

ARI is designed for all audiences, but is particularly effective for high school and college students, as well as young professionals. 

This game was developed during the fall of 2021 over the span of fourteen weeks. Under the supervision of Marist professors Brian Gormanly (brian.gormanly@marist.edu) and Casimer DeCusatis (casimer.decusatis@marist.edu), a team of ten senior students elected to make this cybersecurity training experience a reality.
