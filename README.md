Platformer minigame is to serve as a "loading" screen when the user successfully triggers the VM. Opposed to having a user enter a password or simulate some downtime, have the user play a minigame. Plus the better they are at the better their overall time will be. 

Use W, A, S, D or Up Arrow, Left Arrow, Down Arrow, Right Arrow to navigate around the playing field and avoiding obstacles and reaching the end destination
Once the end is reached, the game will end.
The user is given unlimited attempts but can face a time penalty outside the minigame for failing too many times in a row.
